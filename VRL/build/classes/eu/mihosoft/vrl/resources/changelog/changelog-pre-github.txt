Version:	v0.3.8.12
Date:		Tue, 16 Nov 2010 11:10:12 +0100
-----------------------------------------------

new stable release 0.3.8.12:

new features:

 - added enhanced style support, including laf

 - connection correctness is checked while dragging, type reresentations
   can implement custom compatibility rules, e.g., allow connections
   from connectors with different style

 - additional effects for visualizing method invocation:
   artificially delays invocation and colorizes methods that
   wait for invocation. good for debugging and demonstration
   purposes

 - support for custom param data, i.e., typerepresentations can
   store additional information that can't be stored in the param
   object (used for saving 3d orientation etc.)

 - vrl enables array visualization through special arraybasetype.
   this is a container for other type representations, array elements are
   visualized by normal type representations. adding and removing
   elements is possible. with arrays it is possible to simulate multiple
   return values as the connectors of the element visualizations can be
   used like any other connector (file format supports this now)

 - if a class is currently in use (as visualobject, not as parameter)
   and this class is going to be recompiled, a dialog is shown and asks
   whether to recompile, as all instances of the old class will be
   removed from canvas. this is necessary as instances of the old class
   do not share the same class object anymore and are thus treated as
   instances of another class

 - VGeometry3D allows improved 3d visualizations including vertex
   coloring etc. it can be used as input and output (inputs change
   orientation of the param object)

 - typerepresentations can decide whether to prefer binary serialization. This is useful for
   Collection based values such as ArrayList objects. The VGeometry3DType now uses binary
   serialization for big arrays, e.g., geometries with more than 500 triangles. This
   increases the performance dramatically!

 - typereprensentations can decide whether to serialize values or not.
   if an object is too big or cannot be used because of other reasons
   serialization can be ommited

 - support for session initializer (and finalizer) with groovy support:
   this allows custom actions when loading session, compiling codes etc.

 - initial fullscreen support for type representations and other
   components

 - highly improved drawing performance

 - highly improved memory handling for hidden windows (they release
   unused buffers earlier, effect framework supports this now),
   memory display added (shows memory usage on canvas background)

 - initial presentation support: window groups consider window location
   and animate between window states (currently only location), dock has
   new applets for changing current window group

 - animated layout added: allows to animate almost any swing layout

 - improved architecture specific binary path handling: this is useful
   for executing external binaries or loading libraries

 - type representations allow custom error messages

 - bufferedimagetype supports fixedAspectRatio option

 - number-based type representations support min/max and value option,
   e.g., @ParamInfo(options="min=30.1D;max=33.34D;value=33.0D")

 - category option in component info finally used:
   @ComponentInfo(name="my name", category "cat1/cat2/cat3/") this will
   put this component in the sub menu "cat1/cat2/cat3/"

 - support for multiple visualizations:
   it is possible to have multiple visualizations of the same object
   instance, each visualization has a unique visualID. multiple
   visualization improves codeblock behavior. in previous versions a
   method could not be invoked twice (with different connections).
   This is one step to improved control flow visualization

rangecheck fixed, was wrong for floating point numbers, min was the smallest positive number instead - (the biggest positive number)
